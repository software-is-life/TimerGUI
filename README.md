# Countdown and Stopwatch Timer GUI

Libraries I may need to research:
- STD time & GUI library

Requirements:

pre-conditions
- only accept numbers in GUI input from user
- no character entry for characters or strings

post-conditions
- stopwatch timer displaying culmulative time
- countdown timer displaying remaining time from starting point that user inputted -> GUI prints to screen that time has
elapsed when it reaches to zero

countdown timer:
- cout or print out that the countdown has reached zero
- ensure that numbers or string representation of the numbers are only allowed to be input
- input select field that goes up and down
- time going down is displayed
- buttons start, stop, reset
stopwatch:
- buttons: start, stop, reset
- start button changes to stop when stopwatch is being run

CHANGELOG:
- 05/09/21 Made MVP Countdown and Stopwatch Calculator that receives customer input and outputs time elapsed.
